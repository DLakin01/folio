_Technologies used: C#, JSON, XML, ASP.NET, Azure Functions, Razor Engine, Visual Studio, REST and SOAP APIs, and others_

In my most recent position at OpenWater, Inc. I helped build out a huge hub for integrations of all kinds, called the Islands. The Islands are composed of dozens of serverless Azure Functions, designed to scale with user demand. Each Function fulfills a different customer need, including but not limited to:

* Single Sign On
* Custom search and other widgets
* Data caching for quick access
* API calls to pull information from a customer system
* Pushback of information into a customer system
* Complex custom reports
* Custom HTML pages generated with Razor Engine

In my work with the Islands, I regularly generated and consumed data and code in C#, Python, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, XML, and SAML. My customers used a wide variety of platforms that I learned to integrate and communicate with, including:

* Salesforce
* Azure Active Directory
* netFORUM
* iMIS
* Personify
* CiviCRM
* Impexium
* Certain
* GuideBook
* Core-Apps

During my time with OpenWater, I helped take the Islands from ten Azure Functions to over one hundred. I learned a lot, and am confident I can build equally strong infrastructure heading into the future!
