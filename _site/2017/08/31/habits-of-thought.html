  <article class="post-content">
    <p>When I first had the idea of pursuing coding, it was out of desperation. I had tried to walk another path, tried to pursue another career, but without real success and decreasing chances of changing that. I flirted with the idea of going to law school, going so far as to take the LSAT and apply to several schools. I ultimately pulled back from that option, and am glad of it. Although the end is not assured at all, my experience with Bloc so far has been overwhelmingly positive, and I do genuinely feel that I am learning a valuable and marketable skill.</p>

<p>My habits of thought have changed. Where before I would stare at a page filled with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and see nothing but dense gibberish, I can now pick apart chunks, turn them over in my head, and think about what they do, and in what relation to other parts of an application or project. I can think in loops, imagine groupings of data or information in arrays, objects, or arrays of objects. I am trying to master the larger and more important discipline of DRY, or Don’t Repeat Yourself. If I can attain a certain level of elegance and flow in my code, and at the same time write no more (or close to no more) than I have to, I will have gained a truly important skill.</p>

<p>It’s fascinating how certain methods, properties, or larger concepts can seem utterly foreign or indecipherable for days at a time, and then suddenly slide into place. Suddenly, I can see what the documentation really meant, and how to use the options offered by a certain bit of code. My understanding of the Document Object Model, or DOM, is a perfect example. Reading through those lessons for the first time, I was practically mentally paralyzed. The concepts of a tree of page elements studded with nodes that I could locate and manipulate did not come easily. However, within days, I was using JavaScript, and later jQuery, with increasing ease to locate and change nodes on the DOM. I have used it to create animations, populate HTML templates, and play music.</p>

<p>In the days ahead, there will certainly be new topics that will seem as foreign and confusing to me as the DOM did. However, with time, patience, and effort, I will one day soon find those topics sliding as easily and effortlessly into place as others already have.</p>
