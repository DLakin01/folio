Daniel Lakin is a hardworking and passionate test-first web developer who appreciates and works toward that wonderful feeling when a piece of code clicks into place, and something starts working. He's all about building new features, getting to done, and shipping products.

He's fluent in Angular and Ruby on Rails, prefers non-relational databases but likes the pretty colors in SQL, and loves working with bread-and-butter languages like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. He's also always looking for a new project, so don't be shy!
